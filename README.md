# liri-node-app

## Week 10 (LIRI Bot) Assignment

Created during Week 10 of UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to use Node JS to create a LIRI bot, like iPhone's SIRI, but takes in command through Language vs Speech. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data based on one of four commands:

- my-tweets
- spotify-this-song
- movie-this
- do-what-it-says

## Getting Started
- Clone down repo.
- Run command 'npm install' in Terminal or GitBash
- Create a .env file  add the following to it, replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:
```
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

# Twitter API keys

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-twitter-consumer-key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-twitter-consumer-secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=your-access-token-key
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-twitter-access-token-secret
```
- Get your Twitter API keys by following these steps:
        * Step One: Visit <https://apps.twitter.com/app/new>
        * Step Two: Fill out the form with dummy data. Type `http://google.com` in the Website input. Don't fill out the Callback URL input. Then submit the form.
        * Step Three: On the next screen, click the Keys and Access Tokens tab to get your consume key and secret.
        * Copy and paste them into your .env file, replacing the `your-twitter-consumer-key` and `your-twitter-consumer-secret` placeholders.
        * Step Four: At the bottom of the page, click the `Create my access token` button to get your access token key and secret.
        * Copy the access token key and secret displayed at the bottom of the next screen. Paste them into your .env file, replacing the placeholders for `your-twitter-access-token-key` and `your-twitter-access-token-secret`.

- Get your Spotify **client id** and **client secret** by following these steps:
        * Step One: Visit <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/>
        * Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.
       * Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create> to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. You can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. When finished, click the "complete" button.
        * Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to where you see your client id and client secret. Copy these values down somewhere, you'll need them to use the Spotify API and the [node-spotify-api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api).
